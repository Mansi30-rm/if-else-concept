# Basic Python Projects using If-Else

This repository contains 4 beginner-friendly Python projects that use simple `if-else` conditions. These mini-projects are perfect for anyone who is just getting started with Python and wants to understand how decision-making works.

# Projects Included

1. **Age Checker**
   - Takes user's age as input and checks whether the person is a minor, adult, or senior.
   - Demonstrates use of multiple `if-elif-else` conditions.

2. **Even or Odd Checker**
   - Asks the user for a number and checks if it is even or odd.
   - Simple use of `if-else` condition.

3. **Number Guessing Game**
   - The computer generates a random number between 1 to 100.
   - The user tries to guess it.
   - Uses `if`, `elif`, and `while loop` to give hints like "Too High" or "Too Low".

4. **Simple Calculator**
   - Takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) from the user.
   - Performs the calculation using `if-elif` conditions.

# Concepts Used

- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `input()` function
- Type casting (`int`, `float`)
- Basic arithmetic
- Loop (used in guessing game)

# Ideal For

- Python beginners
- Students learning conditional logic
- Mini practice projects before starting big ones
